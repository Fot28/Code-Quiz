# Code-Quiz

## Description

Given a Code-Quiz Project, I used JavaScript to make a Coding quiz application where you can test your knowledge and save your score along with your initials.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Code-Quiz Project open the website link and click on the Start quiz button then answer the questions. For every wrong answer you will loose 10 seconds from your time in the end you will see your score and you will be able to save it along with your initials then you will transfer to the Hiscores page wher you can acces and manage your highscores.
